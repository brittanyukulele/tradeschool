Teachers submit a class description with a date/time they can teach and a list of items they want in exchange for teaching. Once a class submission is approved, it will be posted to the website. On the day of class, teachers and students meet at Trade School, barter items are given to the teacher, and the class occurs.\r\n\r\nTHE SPACE\r\nTrade School is in at {{ venue.address_1 }}, {{ venue.city }}.
