{# 
    This template is used to render a single past scheduled class.
    
    It extends the course_item.html template that is in the same folder as this one:
    	/public_html/course_item.html
    
    In order to make edits to the html of your TS branch file, 
        1.  Look at the code of the parent template (URL above).
            The HTML inside of the various 'block' elements is filled in the 'block' elements
            that have the same name in this file.
        2.  Copy the content that's in the block element you wish to change from the parent template.
        3.  In the code below, paste it inside the block that has the same name,
            instead of {{ block.super }} 
        4.  Make any edits you wish! 

    *** Keep in mind that the template has django-specific template tags.
    They affect the way it functions, so be careful with those.
    It's probably best to just change / add to the html itself.
